### Movie Recommender.

As a final project for Stats 542 at University of Illinois of Urbana Champaign, we needed to develop a shiny app with a movie recommender system. 

This repository has files needed for that: 

1. The link for the app is the following: https://sleezch.shinyapps.io/movie_recommender/ 
2. The rmd file has the steps considered for developing the recommender, it has two methods, one based on genre and the other one with a built in function to calculate the IBCF recommender.
3. The html is the knitted documment from the rmd file
